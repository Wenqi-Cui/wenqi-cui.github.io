However, their performances suffer from the lack of exploration and the distributional shifts in trajectories once controllers are updated. Moreover, most RL methods require that all states are directly observed, which is difficult to be attained in many settings.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose a trajectory generation algorithm, which adaptively generates new trajectories as if the system is being operated and explored under the updated control policies.

For linear feedback control, we prove that the algorithm generates trajectories with the exact distribution as if they are sampled from the real system using the updated control policy.

We certify network-level stability by breaking the network into subsystems, and by looking at the equilibrium-independent passivity of each subsystem, the network stability is certified through a diagonal stability property of the interconnection matrix. This allows the analysis scale to large networked systems with time-varying equilibria. The proposed method gracefully extrapolates between lossless and lossy systems, and provides a simple yet effective approach to optimize control efforts with guaranteed stability regions.

The short-term reliability evaluation of power systems, which is essential for power system operators in decision making to secure the system real time balancing, calls for the accurate modelling of operating reserve provided by TCLs. However, the particular characteristics of TCLs make their dynamic response different from the traditional generating units, resulting in difficulties to accurately represent the reliability of operating reserve provided by TCLs with conventional reliability model. \n\n\nThis paper proposes a novel multi-state reliability model of operating reserve provided by TCLs considering their dynamic response during the reserve deployment process. An analytical model for characterizing dynamics of operating reserve provided by TCLs is firstly developed based on the migration of TCLs’ room temperature within the temperature hysteresis band. Then, considering the stochastic consumers’ behaviour and ambient temperature, the probability distribution functions of reserve capacity provided by TCLs are obtained by cumulants. On this basis, the states of reserve capacity and the corresponding probabilities at each time instant are obtained for representing the reliability of operating reserve provided by TCLs in the LZ-transform approach. Case studies are conducted to validate the proposed technique.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-state operating reserve model of aggregate thermostatically-controlled-loads for power system short-term reliability evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

Demand response rebound, i.e., the rebound peak of aggregate power, may exist when ACs are controlled by changing the set point temperature. The rebound peak during the recovery period, named lag rebound, may cause significantly higher demand than that prior to the reserve deployment event. The rebound peak during the reserve deployment period, named lead rebound, is rarely considered in previous researches but will constrain the duration time to a short period (e.g., 10 min), which greatly limits the utilization of ACs. \n\n\nThis paper proposes an optimal sequential dispatch strategy of ACs to mitigate the lead-lag rebound, and thus realize flexible control of the duration time from minutes to several hours. To quantify the effects of lead-lag rebound, a capacity-time evaluation framework of the operating reserve is developed. On this basis, ACs are grouped to be dispatched in sequence to mitigate the lead-lag rebound. The co-optimization of sequential dispatch on the capacity dimension and time dimension forms a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel programming problem, in which the consumers' thermal comfort is also guaranteed. Case studies are conducted to validate the proposed strategy.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation and sequential dispatch of operating reserve provided by air conditioners considering lead–lag rebound effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhoubin Liu","Wenqi Cui","et.al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517553262,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517553262,"objectID":"d3c57a03b1b270886737543833e04a01","permalink":"https://wenqi-cui.github.io/publication/design-of-capacity-incentive-and-energy-compensation-for-demand-response-programs/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T06:34:22.264Z","relpermalink":"/publication/design-of-capacity-incentive-and-energy-compensation-for-demand-response-programs/","section":"publication","summary":"Variability and Uncertainties caused by renewable energy sources have called for large amount of balancing services. Demand side resources (DSRs) can be a good alternative of traditional generating units to provide balancing service. In the areas where the electricity market has not been fully established, e.g., China, DSRs can help balance the power system with incentive-based demand response programs. However, there is a lack of information about the interruption cost of consumers in these areas, making it hard to determine the rational amount of capacity incentive and energy compensation for the participants of demand response programs. \n\nThis paper proposes an algorithm to calculate the amount of capacity incentive and energy compensation for demand response programs when there lacks the information about interruption cost. Available statistical information of interruption cost in referenced areas is selected as the referenced data. Interruption cost of the targeted area is converted from the referenced area by product per electricity consumption. On this basis, capacity incentive and energy compensation are obtained to minimize the payment to consumers. Moreover, the loss of consumers is guaranteed to be covered by the revenue they earned from load serving entities.","tags":null,"title":"Design of capacity incentive and energy compensation for demand response programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenqi Cui","Yi Ding","et.al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512196354,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512196354,"objectID":"1912fc21bcf2149160f2d0a4c05078c6","permalink":"https://wenqi-cui.github.io/publication/two-stage-payback-model-for-the-assessment-of-curtailment-services-provided-by-air-conditioners/","publishdate":"2017-12-02T06:32:34.196Z","relpermalink":"/publication/two-stage-payback-model-for-the-assessment-of-curtailment-services-provided-by-air-conditioners/","section":"publication","summary":"Demand-side resources (DSRs) show great potential to help maintain the real-time balance of power system through demand response (DR) programs. However, load payback effect resulted from the control of DSRs poses a threat to the system stability. It is therefore essential to reasonably evaluate payback load so that the benefits of DR will not be over-estimated. Characteristics of load payback effect vary with different types of devices, consumers’ behaviour and control mechanisms. This entails a need to model the payback effect considering different scenarios.\n\n\nThis paper focuses on the load payback effect of air conditioners (ACs) for the provision of curtailment services. Two-stage payback model is proposed to characterize the dynamics of payback load during the curtailment period and the recovery period in a more accurate way. Moreover, indexes of capacity payback and energy payback are designed to evaluate the quantity and duration of the payback load. Illustrative studies indicate that the proposed methods can provide reference for selecting control mechanisms, scheduling dispatched ACs and guiding the recovery behaviour of consumers.","tags":[],"title":"Two-stage payback model for the assessment of curtailment services provided by air conditioners","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[2024/10] I will present our work Leveraging Predictions in Power System Frequency Control: an Adaptive Approach at 2024 INFORMS Annual Meeting in the session ME75 Advances in Data-driven Controls for Renewable Dominated Grids.

To safely operate the system, operators need to check that the states described by this set of ODEs stay within prescribed limits after various faults. Limited by the size and stiffness of the ODEs, current numerical integration techniques are often too slow to be useful in real-time or large-scale resource allocation problems. In addition, detailed system parameters are often not exactly known. Machine learning approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational efforts, but existing methods generally suffer from overfitting and failures to predict unstable behaviors.\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for power system dynamic predictions by learning in the frequency domain. The intuition is that although the system behavior is complex in the time domain, there are relatively few dominate modes in the frequency domain. Therefore, we learn to predict by constructing neural networks with Fourier transform and filtering layers. System topology and fault information are encoded by taking a multi-dimensional Fourier transform, allowing us to leverage the fact that the trajectories are sparse both in time and spatial (across different buses) frequencies. We show that the proposed approach does not need detailed system parameters, speeds up prediction computations by orders of magnitude and is highly accurate for different fault types.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1e0edb64f368cf3c82494eab6c1a98f","permalink":"https://wenqi-cui.github.io/project/fourier-transient/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fourier-transient/","section":"project","summary":"The dynamics of power grids are governed by a large number of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
