These resources lead to a reduction in mechanical inertia but also provide increased flexibility in frequency responses. Namely, their power electronic interfaces can implement almost arbitrary control laws. To design these controllers, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method in searching for optimal non-linear control policy parameterized by neural networks.\nA key challenge is to enforce that a learned controller must be stabilizing. This paper proposes a Lyapunov regularized RL approach for optimal frequency control for transient stability in lossy networks. Because the lack of an analytical Lyapunov function, we learn a Lyapunov function parameterized by a neural network. The losses are specially designed with respect to the physical power system. The learned neural Lyapunov function is then utilized as a regularization to train the neural network controller by penalizing actions that violate the Lyapunov conditions. Case study shows that introducing the Lyapunov regularization enables the controller to be stabilizing and achieve smaller losses.\n","date":1620288048,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620288048,"objectID":"fcc7cf9d76778bf99c0cac5bcbac3fe4","permalink":"https://wenqi-cui.github.io/project/lyapunov-regularized-reinforcement-learning-for-power-system-transient-stability/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T08:00:48.083Z","relpermalink":"/project/lyapunov-regularized-reinforcement-learning-for-power-system-transient-stability/","section":"project","summary":"Transient stability of power systems is becoming increasingly important because of the growing integration of renewable resources.

The short-term reliability evaluation of power systems, which is essential for power system operators in decision making to secure the system real time balancing, calls for the accurate modelling of operating reserve provided by TCLs. However, the particular characteristics of TCLs make their dynamic response different from the traditional generating units, resulting in difficulties to accurately represent the reliability of operating reserve provided by TCLs with conventional reliability model. \n\n\nThis paper proposes a novel multi-state reliability model of operating reserve provided by TCLs considering their dynamic response during the reserve deployment process. An analytical model for characterizing dynamics of operating reserve provided by TCLs is firstly developed based on the migration of TCLs‚Äô room temperature within the temperature hysteresis band. Then, considering the stochastic consumers‚Äô behaviour and ambient temperature, the probability distribution functions of reserve capacity provided by TCLs are obtained by cumulants. On this basis, the states of reserve capacity and the corresponding probabilities at each time instant are obtained for representing the reliability of operating reserve provided by TCLs in the LZ-transform approach. Case studies are conducted to validate the proposed technique.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-state operating reserve model of aggregate thermostatically-controlled-loads for power system short-term reliability evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

Demand response rebound, i.e., the rebound peak of aggregate power, may exist when ACs are controlled by changing the set point temperature. The rebound peak during the recovery period, named lag rebound, may cause significantly higher demand than that prior to the reserve deployment event. The rebound peak during the reserve deployment period, named lead rebound, is rarely considered in previous researches but will constrain the duration time to a short period (e.g., 10 min), which greatly limits the utilization of ACs. \n\n\nThis paper proposes an optimal sequential dispatch strategy of ACs to mitigate the lead-lag rebound, and thus realize flexible control of the duration time from minutes to several hours. To quantify the effects of lead-lag rebound, a capacity-time evaluation framework of the operating reserve is developed. On this basis, ACs are grouped to be dispatched in sequence to mitigate the lead-lag rebound. The co-optimization of sequential dispatch on the capacity dimension and time dimension forms a mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel programming problem, in which the consumers' thermal comfort is also guaranteed. Case studies are conducted to validate the proposed strategy.","tags":[],"title":"Evaluation and sequential dispatch of operating reserve provided by air conditioners considering lead‚Äìlag rebound effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhoubin Liu","Wenqi Cui","et.al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517553262,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517553262,"objectID":"d3c57a03b1b270886737543833e04a01","permalink":"https://wenqi-cui.github.io/publication/design-of-capacity-incentive-and-energy-compensation-for-demand-response-programs/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T06:34:22.264Z","relpermalink":"/publication/design-of-capacity-incentive-and-energy-compensation-for-demand-response-programs/","section":"publication","summary":"Variability and Uncertainties caused by renewable energy sources have called for large amount of balancing services. Demand side resources (DSRs) can be a good alternative of traditional generating units to provide balancing service. In the areas where the electricity market has not been fully established, e.g., China, DSRs can help balance the power system with incentive-based demand response programs. However, there is a lack of information about the interruption cost of consumers in these areas, making it hard to determine the rational amount of capacity incentive and energy compensation for the participants of demand response programs. \n\nThis paper proposes an algorithm to calculate the amount of capacity incentive and energy compensation for demand response programs when there lacks the information about interruption cost. Available statistical information of interruption cost in referenced areas is selected as the referenced data. Interruption cost of the targeted area is converted from the referenced area by product per electricity consumption. On this basis, capacity incentive and energy compensation are obtained to minimize the payment to consumers. Moreover, the loss of consumers is guaranteed to be covered by the revenue they earned from load serving entities.","tags":null,"title":"Design of capacity incentive and energy compensation for demand response programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenqi Cui","Yi Ding","et.al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512196354,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512196354,"objectID":"1912fc21bcf2149160f2d0a4c05078c6","permalink":"https://wenqi-cui.github.io/publication/two-stage-payback-model-for-the-assessment-of-curtailment-services-provided-by-air-conditioners/","publishdate":"2017-12-02T06:32:34.196Z","relpermalink":"/publication/two-stage-payback-model-for-the-assessment-of-curtailment-services-provided-by-air-conditioners/","section":"publication","summary":"Demand-side resources (DSRs) show great potential to help maintain the real-time balance of power system through demand response (DR) programs. However, load payback effect resulted from the control of DSRs poses a threat to the system stability. It is therefore essential to reasonably evaluate payback load so that the benefits of DR will not be over-estimated. Characteristics of load payback effect vary with different types of devices, consumers‚Äô behaviour and control mechanisms. This entails a need to model the payback effect considering different scenarios.\n\n\nThis paper focuses on the load payback effect of air conditioners (ACs) for the provision of curtailment services. Two-stage payback model is proposed to characterize the dynamics of payback load during the curtailment period and the recovery period in a more accurate way. Moreover, indexes of capacity payback and energy payback are designed to evaluate the quantity and duration of the payback load.
