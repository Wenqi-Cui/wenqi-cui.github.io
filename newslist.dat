**[2022/10]** Honored to be selected as a [Rising Star in EECS](https://risingstars.utexas.edu/).
**[2022/09]** Had a wonderful journey as a research intern at Microsoft Research. We worked on sample-efficient learning-based control algorithms to overcome the challenges of partial observability, sample complexity and the lack of real-time communication capability in real-world applications, including power and traffic networks.
