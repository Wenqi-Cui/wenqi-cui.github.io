      <title>Few-Shot Machine Learning Classification of Electron Microscopy Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a UW-DIRECT capstone project cooperated with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and mentored by Marjolein Oostrom, Sarah Akers and Dr. Steven R. Spurgeon.
We proposed a few-Shot machine learning algorithum for classification of
electron microscopy images and implemented a graphical-user interface for it.
I am responsible for implementing training loop for few-shot machine learning analysis of electron microscope data. 
Transfer learning is utilized to improvement performance of resent on feature extraction of microscope images. The abstract is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent growth in data volumes produced by modern electron microscopes requires rapid, scalable, and flexible approaches to image segmentation and analysis. Few-shot machine learning, which can richly classify images from a handful of user-provided examples, is a promising route to high-throughput analysis. However, current command-line implementations of such approaches can be slow and unintuitive to use, lacking the real-time feedback necessary to perform effective classification. Here we report on the development of a Python-based graphical user interface that enables end users to easily conduct and visualize the output of few-shot learning models. This interface is lightweight and can be hosted locally or on the web, providing the opportunity to reproducibly conduct, share, and crowd-source few-shot analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green Seattle - Prediction and Visualization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Green Seattle is an inter-disciplinary project in Clearn Energy Insitute (CEI) collaborated by seven students majoring in Chemical Sciences, 
Political Science and Electrical Engineering. The first part of Green Seattle is focused on predicting Seattle Traffic Trends 
(codes are publicly available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Greening-Seattle/Prediction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), 
while the second is focused on Visualizing Seattle Traffic Trends, 
as well as outputs of a regression model seeking to predict future traffic patterns based on user inputs
(codes are publicly available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Greening-Seattle/Visualization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). 
I am responsible for implementing machine learning framework for predicting Traffic Trends using Tensorflow 2.0,
and visualizing the model in TensorBoard.&lt;/p&gt;
